Whose Labor?
Your finished Maps product is built using many systems: programming languages, development environments, software packages, hardware, etc.  Whose labor do you rely on when you run your capstone demo? Enumerate at least 12 different packages, tools, hardware components, etc. that you implicitly or explicitly used during this weekâ€™s work. 

Hint: consider the stack: what do you rely on for your front-end, back-end, etc.?
